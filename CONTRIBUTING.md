### How to contribute

Even if you know nothing about programming, there are several ways to contribute:

- If it currently does not solve all your needs, make a feature request on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/spillerrec/Overmix/issues), or comment on an existing one.
- If you fail to stitch an image properly, create an issue and share a link to the input images. Either I can help find you the right settings, or identify a current limitation of Overmix.
- If you can't figure out how to use some part of the program even after checking the wiki (or even it was just difficult), create an issue/bug report. This mean that either the interface is not intuitive enough, documentation is lacking, or the documentation is not clear enough.
